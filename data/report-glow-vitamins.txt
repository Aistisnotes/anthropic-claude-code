6. MECHANISM (Causal Chain Analysis)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ads with mechanism: 4/7 (57%)
  Ads with COMPLETE chain (all 5 steps): 2/7

  Most commonly missing chain steps:
    "Root cause (villain)" — missing in 3/7 ads
    "How this works" — missing in 3/7 ads
    "Why others fail" — missing in 3/7 ads
    "Problem state" — missing in 1/7 ads

    Step 3 — Why other solutions fail:
      "One customer, Sarah from Austin, wrote to us saying she had tried over
      a dozen supplement brands before finding Glow and that nothing els..."
    Step 4 — How this mechanism works:
      "We also integrated bioavailable zinc, selenium, and a full-spectrum
      B-complex to support immune resilience and cognitive clarity."
      "What sets Glow Vitamins apart from the crowded supplement market is our
      commitment to third-party testing."
    Step 5 — The outcome:
      "Clinical trials conducted with over 1,200 participants showed a 34%
      improvement in energy levels after just 30 days of consistent use."
