# Framework Element Definitions

## Target Customer
The avatar the ad speaks to. Who specifically is this ad written for? Demographics, psychographics, situation.

## Mass Desire
The broad, universal desire the ad taps into — one that fits a huge number of people. Not the specific pain point, but the deeper want behind it.
- If the pain point is knee pain, the mass desire is "Moving without pain"
- If the pain point is fatigue, the mass desire might be "Having energy to live fully"

## Pain Points & Pain Point Symptoms
The surface-level problems the target customer experiences. What they feel, see, and deal with daily. These are the symptoms they can name and relate to.

## Root Cause
The deeper "why" behind the pain points. Externalizes blame — gives them a villain (broken system, misinformation, hidden biological mechanism). Shifts from "I'm the problem" to "Now I know what's really wrong." See: framework-rootcause.md

## Mechanism (The "New Mechanism")
The method, approach, or hidden system that uniquely solves the root cause. NOT the product itself. This is the conceptual bridge between understanding the problem and believing the solution exists. See: framework-mechanism.md

## Product Delivery Mechanism
The actual product: its ingredients, form factor, delivery system, technology. How the mechanism is physically delivered to the customer.

## Market Sophistication Stage
Schwartz's 5 stages (1-5). Most ecom markets are Stage 3-5. Determines which strategic response is needed: New Mechanism, New Information, or New Identity. See: framework-market-sophistication.md

## Customer Awareness Stage (Schwartz's 5 Levels)
1. **Unaware** — Don't know they have a problem
2. **Problem-Aware** — Know the problem, don't know solutions exist
3. **Solution-Aware** — Know solutions exist, don't know your product
4. **Product-Aware** — Know your product, haven't bought yet
5. **Most Aware** — Know your product, just need a deal/push

## Big Idea
The overarching concept of how the avatar with X pain point gets from having a problem to getting the outcome. It's the entire concept wrapped in one — plus the ad creative style (how we're selling that idea). The one dominant concept the ad is built around.
