### Quality scoring guidelines:
- **analysis_confidence**: How confident you are in this analysis (0-1). Lower if ad content is vague, short, or ambiguous.
- **copy_quality_score**: Quality of the ad copy/script itself (0-1). Consider: clarity of message, emotional resonance, specificity of claims, strength of hook, CTA effectiveness.

Be ruthlessly specific. Every insight should be traceable to actual content in the ad.
