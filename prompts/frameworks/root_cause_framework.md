1. What Is a Root Cause Explanation (And Why It Matters)
The root cause explanation is one of the most critical parts of a high-converting advertorial. It
comes right after the emotional story when the reader is already hooked and asking,
“Why
hasn’t anything worked?”
This isn’t where you educate. It’s where you reframe. Your job is to make sense of their lived
experience by showing why surface-level fixes failed and revealing a deeper ROOT cause they
either never heard of, never fully understood, or never realized was the real issue. Once it
clicks, your product becomes the only solution that actually fits.
This is also where you externalize the problem. If they blame themselves, they freeze. So give
them a villain: a broken system, a misinformation loop, or a hidden mechanism like cortisol or
inflammation. That shift from “I’m the problem” to “Now I know what’s really wrong” builds relief,
urgency, and belief.
If the background story builds emotion, the root cause builds clarity. Together, they form the
bridge from stuck to sold. Once the root cause clicks, half the sale is already done.
2. What Makes a Good Root Cause Explanation
The root cause section helps the reader understand why nothing has worked without making
them feel dumb, broken, or blamed.
It doesn’t sound like a science lecture. It sounds like someone finally explaining the real reason
in a way that clicks.
A good root cause section does a few important things:
●
It makes everything finally make sense.
The symptoms, the failed solutions, the frustration it all connects.
●
It gives the reader something to point to.
They can say,
“That’s what’s really been going on,
” instead of guessing or blaming
themselves.
●
It takes the pressure off.
You’re not telling them they did something wrong. You’re showing them the real problem
was hidden or never fully explained.
●
It introduces a villain.
Something or someone that kept them stuck: a broken system, bad advice, or a deeper
issue no one told them about. Once they can blame that, they stop blaming themselves.
●
It’s easy to understand.
No big words. No long paragraphs. Just plain, clear language. Bonus points if you use a
Analogy that helps it land instantly.
When this part is done right, the reader feels a mix of relief, clarity, and curiosity.
That’s when they’re finally ready to see the solution.
3. Key Psychological Principles That Make This Work
A good root cause explanation doesn’t work because it’s “smart.
”
It works because it’s easy to understand and easy to believe even for someone tired,
distracted, or emotionally drained.
Here are the four key psychological levers that make your root cause explanation land:
1. System 1 First
People buy with emotion (System 1), not logic (System 2).
So your root cause should feel instantly true before they even stop to think.
Don’t give them something to figure out.
Give them something they can feel in their gut.
✅ Use emotion, metaphor, and clarity.
✅ Let the logic ride underneath the story just enough to make it click.
2. Processing Fluency
If it’s hard to understand, they bounce.
The brain sees “easy to read” as “must be true.
”
So you need:
●
Short lines
●
No jargon
●
Visual flow
●
Simple, clear language
Make it so smooth that even a tired, half-scrolling reader can say,
“Oh. That makes sense.
”
3. The Villain
If they blame themselves, they freeze.
You need to give them something outside of themselves to blame.
That could be:
●
A broken system (pharma, industry, internet advice)
●
A misinformation loop (“You were told it was just stress…
”)
●
A hidden mechanism (hormones, inflammation, cortisol)
Once there’s a clear villain, they stop feeling ashamed and start feeling ready to act.
“It’s not me. It’s that.
”
That shift builds trust and motivation.
4. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
No fluff. No lectures. No big words.
This part should read like a trusted expert finally saying it in plain language—not like a
research paper, and not like a casual guess.
It should feel like:
“A real doctor finally explained it in a way I could actually understand.
”
Simple = clear.
Clear = believable.
Believable = actionable.
If someone is tired, dumb, stressed, or brain rote scrolling, on their phone can get it, you did it
right.
That’s when belief locks in and action follows.
💡 Pro Tip: Use Analogies to Make It Click
Analogies are one of the most powerful tools you have.
They turn invisible problems into something visual.
They remove mental effort. And they make your explanation feel obvious.
Whenever possible, use analogies your audience is already familiar with.
You can find great ones by searching Reddit, YouTube comments, or real conversations in your
niche.
✅ Example:
For sciatica, the most common analogy is the jelly donut where the disc is the donut, and the
jelly slips out and presses on a nerve. People instantly get it.
If there’s no popular analogy, make one up.
Just make sure it’s visual, simple, and emotionally accurate.
If they can picture it, they’ll believe it.
And if they believe it, they’re ready to hear the solution.
