### Analysis guidelines:
- **Frequency**: Count how many ads exhibit each pattern (out of {{total_ads}}).
- **Percentage**: frequency / total_ads.
- **Be specific**: Don't just say "pain points about health." Say "72% of ads lead with inability to sleep through the night, specifically targeting the 3am wake-up pattern."
- **Find the non-obvious**: What patterns would a casual observer miss?
- **Contradictions**: Note any contradictory approaches across ads—this reveals testing strategies.
- **Key insights** should be genuinely useful for someone building a competing ad strategy.
- **Recommendations** should be actionable and grounded in the pattern data.
