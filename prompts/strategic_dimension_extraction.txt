## Your Task

Analyze these ads and extract patterns across 6 strategic dimensions. Focus on UNDERLYING DR STRATEGY, not ad craft.

### DIMENSION 1: ROOT CAUSES

What does this brand claim CAUSES the problem?

Extract:
- **Root Cause Text**: The exact explanation of what causes the problem
- **Depth Level**: surface (symptom-level) / moderate (mechanism-level) / deep (systemic) / cellular (biological) / molecular (biochemical)
- **Upstream Gap**: What causes THIS root cause? (The missing upstream explanation)
- **Frequency**: How many ads reference this root cause
- **Example Ad Copy**: Direct quote showing this root cause explanation
- **Psychological Principle**: Which principle is used? (System 1 thinking, villain externalization, processing fluency, KISS)

**Root Cause Framework Rules:**
- Look for the "villain" - what's externalized as the enemy?
- Does it make sense without effort? (Processing fluency)
- Does it use analogies to click instantly?
- Does it feel obvious in hindsight?

### DIMENSION 2: MECHANISMS

What does this brand claim their solution DOES and HOW?

Extract:
- **Mechanism Text**: The exact explanation of what the solution does
- **Mechanism Type**: new_mechanism (revolutionary delivery/tech) / new_information (education/reframe) / new_identity (lifestyle/tribal)
- **Depth**: claim-only ("works for X") / process-level ("activates Y pathway") / cellular ("targets Z cells") / molecular ("binds to receptor")
- **Frequency**: How many ads reference this mechanism
- **Example Ad Copy**: Direct quote showing mechanism explanation
- **Believability Score**: 0-1 (how credible does this feel?)
- **Connects to Root Cause**: true/false (does it directly solve the root cause above?)

**Mechanism Framework Rules:**
- Does it directly fix the root cause revealed?
- Does it feel obvious in hindsight?
- Is it simple enough that a tired person scrolling would get it?
- Does it use visual metaphors?

### DIMENSION 3: TARGET AUDIENCE

WHO does this brand speak to?

Extract:
- **Demographics**: Age range, gender, location, income level (from ad context/targeting)
- **Psychographics**: Values, lifestyle, concerns, aspirations evident in copy
- **Identity**: "People who are..." statement - tribal belonging, anti-establishment angle, cultural positioning
- **Frequency**: How many ads speak to this avatar
- **Example Ad Copy**: Direct quote showing avatar targeting

**Market Sophistication Context:**
- Stage 3-5 markets: Identity becomes critical (67% influenced by brand story/values)
- Look for "Not another [category], but for people who..."

### DIMENSION 4: PAIN POINTS

What SPECIFIC problems does this brand lead with?

Extract:
- **Pain Point**: The exact problem (e.g., "crepey skin on arms", not just "aging skin")
- **Intensity**: low (minor annoyance) / medium (daily frustration) / high (major life impact) / extreme (devastating)
- **Frequency**: How many ads lead with this pain point
- **Example Ad Copy**: Direct quote agitating this pain
- **Emotional Trigger**: fear / shame / frustration / anxiety / loss / regret

Rank by frequency (most common pain points first).

### DIMENSION 5: PAIN POINT SYMPTOMS

What DAILY EXPERIENCES or observable symptoms does this brand reference?

Extract:
- **Symptom**: The specific daily experience (e.g., "waking up with puffy face", "avoiding sleeveless shirts")
- **Frequency**: How many ads reference this symptom
- **Example Ad Copy**: Direct quote mentioning symptom

These are more specific than pain points - they're the LIVED EXPERIENCES that make pain real.

### DIMENSION 6: MASS DESIRES

What TRANSFORMATION does this brand promise?

Extract:
- **Desire**: The outcome/transformation promised
- **Timeframe**: "in 30 days", "overnight", "within 2 weeks", etc.
- **Specificity**: vague ("feel better") / moderate ("reduce puffiness") / specific ("eliminate under-eye bags") / measurable ("reduce wrinkle depth by 40%")
- **Frequency**: How many ads promise this desire
- **Example Ad Copy**: Direct quote showing transformation promise

**Mass Desire Patterns:**
- Surface desires: cosmetic improvements
- Deeper desires: confidence, social acceptance, feeling young again
- Identity desires: becoming the person who has solved this

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Extract from actual ad data provided** - do not invent patterns
2. **Use direct quotes** for example_ad_copy - copy exact text from ads
3. **Rank by frequency** - most common patterns first
4. **Focus on DR strategy** - root causes, mechanisms, avatars (NOT hooks, formats, CTAs)
5. **Apply framework principles** - use root cause and mechanism frameworks to assess depth and quality
6. **Mark sophistication level** - identify if mechanisms are Stage 3 (new mechanism), Stage 4 (mechanism enhancement), or Stage 5 (identity)
